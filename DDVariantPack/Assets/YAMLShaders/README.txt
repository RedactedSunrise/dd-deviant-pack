This folder contains the vanilla shaders of Hopoo games in YAML format.
This means that here you can find shaders that will work in editor and display a rough representation of how it'll look like ingame.

Please note that the contents of this folder are gitignored, the exception being this .txt file and the .meta files
If you dont know how to get your own copy of the YAML shaders, ask nebby.
